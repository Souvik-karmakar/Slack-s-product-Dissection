## Problem Statement

Product Dissection for top leading Platforms

Welcome to this case study on dissecting and designing products for top leading platforms. In this case study, you will delve into the intriguing world of schema design for a prominent platform of your choice. Your task is to choose a top leading platform, research its features, and meticulously craft a schema design that encapsulates the essence of its functionality. By focusing on key entities, attributes, and relationships, you will gain invaluable insights into how data architecture drives the platform's effectiveness.

Step 1: Choose a Leading Platform
Select a leading platform of your choice, which could span various domains such as social media, e-commerce, finance, or any other industry. This choice will form the foundation of your exploration into its schema design.

Step 2: Research:
Thoroughly research the platform you have selected. Investigate its core features, functionalities, and user interactions. Identify the top features that define its user experience and contribute significantly to its popularity.

Step 3: Product Dissection and Real World Problems solved by the platform
In this step, you will meticulously analyse the platform's standout features and how they provide innovative solutions to real-world challenges. By identifying key functionalities that resonate with users, you'll unravel how the platform effectively addresses problems and enhances user experiences. This dissection will serve as the foundation for understanding how the schema design aligns with the platform's core objectives.

Step 4: Case Study on the real world problems and approach to solving them
In this pivotal step, you will expand on the real-world challenges uncovered in Step 3 through a comprehensive case study. Delve into specific instances where users encountered difficulties and showcase how the platform's unique features provided effective solutions. By dissecting the approach taken by the platform to overcome these challenges, you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the platform's user-centric design philosophy and how it shapes the schema design.

Step 5: Schema Design Based on Top Features
Based on the features you have identified, craft a schema design that reflects the platform's data structure. Focus on the key entities, attributes, and relationships that underpin the chosen features. Your schema should capture the essence of how the platform organises and utilises its data.


Step 6: Rationale Behind the Design
While creating the schema design, consider the rationale behind the platform's choices. Reflect on why certain entities and relationships were chosen and how they align with the platform's goals. This will help you understand the strategic decisions driving the schema's architecture.

Step 7: Create an ER Diagram
Utilise tools like the Miro platform or similar applications to create an illustrative Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram. This diagram should vividly depict the entities, attributes, and relationships present within your schema design. The ER diagram will serve as a visual representation of your insights.

Step 8: Presentation of Findings
Present your findings in a clear and concise manner. Showcase your understanding of how the schema design impacts the platform's functionality and user experience. Explain how your chosen features are integrated into the schema and how the schema's structure supports the platform's objectives.
